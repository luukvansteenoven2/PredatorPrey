# Project Title
Investigating the population dynamics of Prestigeous Predators and Preys under different models

## Description
This project aimes to improve the understanding of predator-prey interactions in ecological systems.
We investigated population dynamics of the Canadian Lynx and Snowshoe Hare using two models. 
We used Lotka-Volterra for the analytical model and an agent based model for a simulational model. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
List any libraries, tools, or frameworks that your project depends on.
Our project depends on the following common-used packages:

matplotlib (3.4.3), numpy (1.26.0), scipy(1.12.0), math

### Installing

To install the program, simply use 'git pull' or download them directly.
When downloading them directly, make sure to place all files in the same working directory for the program to work.

### Executing program
The files code_sensitivity, historical_data_visualization, LVmodel, simulation can be ran independently of eachother and each produces their desired output,
Though it is important to note that for code_sensitivity and simulation, the file simulation_visualization is also needed to support its visualization

code_sensitivity: investigates the sensitivity of the killProb parameter of our simulation model
historial_data_visualization: visualizes the historical population amounts of Lynx and Hares
LVmodel: our analytical Lotka-Volterra model
simulation: our own agent-based simulational model
simulation_visualization: the code file that makes the live visualization through timesteps of the simulation possible
